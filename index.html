            To tell you a little about me my name is Demarcus Lester. I am 23 years old and live in Memphis, TN. I
            was born and raised here so I'm very familar with the city and culture. I graduated highschool in 2016
            and went to UT Knoxville the same year. I came home in late 2017 and have been working on the security
            indstry for two plus years now. I have decided early 2021 to pursue programming through this program
            with CodeCrew and am excited for the journey!
